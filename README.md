These are algorithms I did in my coding bootcamp, Coding Dojo, that I have done and solved.

The html document is a tester to see if my solutions work after attempting to solve them.

I also had a file for planning my projects todo while at the Dojo but have it ignored due irrelevance to the algorithm practice.

P.S. Also moved solo project details to another folder and repository for the class.
